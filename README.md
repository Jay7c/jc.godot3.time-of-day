## Status:
> 1.1.x dev
------------------------------------

## Mono version?
> The C# version will come back later.

## Reflections:
> Optimal reflections are possible with a well-configured reflection probe. 
------------------------------------


## Limitations: 
- You can only get reflections with a reflection probe. 
- The sky model and clouds does not have support for altitude variation. 

## Future:
- Currently it is experimental, for godot 4 I will improve the plugin(I will use this plugin in my game)

## Feedback is welcome.
